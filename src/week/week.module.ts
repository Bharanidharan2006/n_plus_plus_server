// --- This module should only be accessed by reps -----
// 1. Reps can create a timetable for each week by clicking create which gives the default timetable and they can edit any classed that have changed for that week. Then they can send "CreateWeek" mutation;
// 2. They can edit classes if any changes are to be made later using "editWeek" mutation;
// 3. getAllWeeks() -> returns all the weeks created so far
// 4. getLatestWeek() -> returns the ongoing week( week with the highest week no ); + This function is called by methods in the user module to get the ongoing week data;
// 5. deleteWeek -> it only allows the deletion of the latest week. ***Should find a way to add a undo option to this delete method***
